Youtube giveaway helper 2.0
===========================

This is a brand new version of my old utility for finding random winners of youtube giveaways written in java for crossplatform rather than C#.
It is more advanced and uses a different technique for extracting the data off the website.

The repo is of my eclipse directory.
The program uses the async-http-client, jsoup, and slf4j libaries and are bundled for convenience.
